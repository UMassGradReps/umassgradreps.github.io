    - Do not prop the door open!
- Upcoming deadlines:
    - Sabbatical leave deadlines
    - Next Faculty meeting is Mon Oct 17 @ noon
## Dean's comments
- Venture fund approved up to the level of around $200k
- Starting a review of various efforts of maker spaces on campus. Not very integrated yet, talk on spending a lot of money to do a makerspace in the fine arts center bridge. Pushing them to consider spaces on the north side of campus as well.
MS in Information Social Computing is under discussion w/ provost. Developing Information Science program for the college similar to what Cornell has. Associated w/ provost talking to Eng/CS loosely, asking us how we'd do a large scale expansion.
- Reminder on Faculty/Staff giving campaign: matches donations. Have had $13k already donated, primarily from emeritus faculty.
- Dean's opportunity fund can also be donated to.
- Dean interviews around mid-November.
## Committee & Staff reports
- Hack UMass Oct 8/9, urgent need for faculty judges.
- Not asking to spend overnight, asking to just be there for judging session Sunday afternoon.
- Awards committee: committee is larger than usual, more awards to give. Appeal for crowdsourcing, if you know about an award that might be appropriate for you or someone else, let Chip know.
    - Would also be good to know about awards someone might be up for in the future
- Honor's program
    - Rules changed. If you're advising student this semester all of the dates have changed, they've all moved up. For this spring date for submitting material is Dec 9.
- Scheduling process for spring has proceeded to the point of a draft schedule being out. CS383 and CS451/451G need instructors.       Could use a grad student who could teach.
- Scheduling process for next year is at asking for information stage.
- If teaching two courses, give 5 courses you're willing to teach. Wants n+3 courses.
- Grad program: sometimes faced with ACM dissertation award nominations, having to narrow it down to a small number. Dissertations are hard to compare. Propose to circulate nominations among faculty for them to weigh in how they feel about it.
- Robert Canterbank of Duke had to cancel Oct talk, moved to Nov. Shortage of DLS funding to support 5 speakers, will be a bit theory heavy this semester. Oct 17: Monday, 10am.
- College career fair is next Thursday. 14 companies that we'll fit into CS150/151. Will send more emails about it. Career fair is from 10-3pm. 
## Trust assurance and cyber security center update
- Certificate program
    - $3m for 10y grant/gift that was given to UMass Amherst by Mass Mutual
- Idea: bring people from all kinds of levels through a midlife career change but not deciding on a stereotype.
- People who began working at MM but didn't have traditional college background, MM wants to move them through certificate program.  Also people who are working as UMass Amherst working in IT.
- DOES NOT require matriculation to Umass Amherst
- Faculty certified certificate program
- Program designed to provide an individual at the end of 4 courses a broad overview of cyber security
Professional program
- Taught with a very academic sense of rigor
- Courses will probably come to comprise "tracks"
- Courses (200 and 500 level):
    - Internet law and policy
    - Information risk management
    - Introduction to computer security
    - TACC capstone - half co-op, half class
    - Considering adding a privacy and surveillance course
- Talk of masters level and summer programs
- Meet in 8wk chunks
- Concentrated at the UMass Springfield courses
- 4hrs, 2x/wk
- Open house this Thursday
- Next Wednesday is virtual open house
- Invites will be sent out to the IT community
- Questions
    - How big is it right now? 10 students, 3 from UMass, 6 from MM, 1 other
    - Are the UMass AMherst students in CS? They are 3 employees
    - To the audience? Is there a way to get these students matriculated so it could be cheaper tuition? Could make it part of the CS degree program perhaps.
- Send interested people Tracy's way
## Elliot Moss update on proposed definition of grad core course
- By default, a regular course with a stable syllabus, which the college is committed to teach on a regular basis, is "core"
- The faculty may specifically designate a course as non-core
- 600 level and above for phd/ms-phd, 500 and above for MS only
- Required cores in particular areas, etc, continue
- Regular course = x00-x89 (not 701)
- Maybe include x90 or x97
- These require pre-clearance from dean of faculty senate, but does not have to go through critique w/in CS
- Or allow this after the fact when the course obtains a "proper number"
- Regular basis = at least once every 2 years
- NOT removing required cores (i.e., for theory), just opening up non-required cores.
- Changing name from core classes would require a re proposal of degree
- Cores must be committed to teach, but it is possible that the college would not meet that committment due to sabbatical etc
- Currently all courses that are regularly offered here are cores, this proposal is just changing the default
- Motion tabled discussion ended
## Lisa Henderson talking about MSP (faculty union)
- Starting successor bargaining for a new contract that will hopefully be done before the house 1 budget.
- A number of informal or ad hoc subcommittees established to talk about issues important to faculty
    - Class size
    - School is talking about enrollment minimums, debate about whether those kinds of decisions should come from departments or the school handling it
    - Difference between policy and guidelines
    - Status of non-tenure track faculty
    - Internal policy that we call some non-tenure track faculty as 'teaching faculty'
- Tried to write up policy and use it in recruiting, but couldn't use the language b/c of the union contract
- Research faculty nominations
- Article 35 of the contract (continuing and prof education)
- How instructors are compensated
- Workload language, what constitutes a change in workload
- Language for librarians
- Joint task force on resource allocation
    - Transparency of allocation to the deans and below the deans offices
    - MSP urges faculty to be mindful of allocations, ask questions, request accountability
- MSP w/ MTA (parent union) is opposing question 2 on November ballot, which lifts the cap on charter schools in MA
    - Charters will remove more than $400m from the public school fund this year
    - Bill is lobbied by for-profit charter corporations
- Fair share amendment
    - Proposed last year calling for income tax increases for people making over $1m/yr
    - Discussion was shut down on this
- MSP concern was that nominations for exceptional merit awards was that nominations were not regulated, provost didn't have to listen to what had been recommended
