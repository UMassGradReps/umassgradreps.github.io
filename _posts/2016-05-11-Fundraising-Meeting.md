Grad Reps and [Social Committee](http://umasscssocial.weebly.com/) held a meeting to discuss the budget situation and potential social activities for the upcoming year. 

# Fundraising ideas (and general event/social ideas)

One of our big picture ideas is the idea of improving recognition of students who volunteer for service positions. We might be able to get some small budget for GEO/GSS volunteers, either through GSO budget or from the department, but we can also provide intangible rewards through recognition of effort. A service award has been discussed, and we came up with the idea of a "service retreat" which is a low cost event for all volunteers from the whole year held in the Spring. [Emma](http://cs.umass.edu/~etosch) is planning to do a picnic/BBQ version of this event on ~5/23, possibly at [Puffer's Pond](http://www.amherstma.gov/1316/Puffers-Pond), [Mt. Tom](http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-west/mount-tom-state-reservation.html) or [Groff Park](https://www.amherstma.gov/1756/Groff-Park). We also thought of adding a bit of service recognition to the XMas student/fac/staff party.

Related to improving student involvement in social events, we discussed the development of a "service fair" to be held before [Grad Elections]() in the Fall where the various student orgs/communities in the dept would set up to talk, particularly to new students, about what they do, and hopefully to "recruit" new students. This should help get new students more involved, and also give us all more people to work on all our grand ideas. [Emma](http://cs.umass.edu/~etosch) plans to talk to staff about setting up tables somewhere. We could possibly do it outside if space is an issue.

**Specific events + notes:**

Chili cookoff, bakeoff, and international day

* Chili cookoff held relatively early in the fall?
* Advertise to other departments
* Possibly get tshirts, maybe next year
* Ticket price should increase
* Would MassMutual/Fiksu/etc be interested in sponsoring?

* Bakeoff in the spring? or perhaps 2x next year

* [Amee](http://cs.umass.edu/~amee) suggested "International Day," possibly doing during the summer
* Maybe rent a community center up near North Village for ID? Somewhere closer to the big international communities

Monetizing Share Coffee/other coops

* Have an annual membership fee for the [Share](https://www.sharecoffeeroasters.com/) coop (currently run by [Dan Barowy](http://cs.umass.edu/~dbarowy))
* Sell T-Shirts, sponsored by Share as advertising? maybe membership comes with a tshirt?
* Have a cupping, or maybe a coffee competition, as fundraising but also advertising for the coop

* Could we do the same with a farmshare coop?

Family-friendly events

* Pumpkin carving, easter egg deco, valentine's cookie deco
* Timing is very important, but charging a few dollars is easy to justify for materials
* Should be low commitment, but attendance at the one we've done was poor already

Trivia night/other competition w/ prizes

* General/CS trivia night, $5 entry, teams of 5, some %payout to top N teams
* Omegathon game competition w/ prizes
* A raffle or 50/50 was mentioned, but legally dubious

Art sale/commissions

* Sell student artwork/crafts
* To other students? organize it like commissions?
* Could get a booth at [Amherst Craft Festival](http://www.umass.edu/ofr/appleHarvest.php) and collect a lot of student work
* Unclear if there are enough artists to hit critical mass, maybe we should put out feelers?

Other

* [Rod's](http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/home.html) BBQ/Marathon
* Resume review/mentoring of new students
* Alumni events
* Fall mixer
