* Unlike other awards, this award isn't tied to a specific time (as the Outstanding Synthesis Award and Outstanding Dissertation Award are)
* We currently don’t have a UMass/CICS-only award that is general (easier for outsiders to understand)
* Perhaps will subsume the Synthesis Award in the future?
* Faculty raised concerns about self-nomination
* Tabled for now
