*Updates:*

- Cafe construction postponed due to surprisingly high quote.
- 160 applications to the REU program.
- We have TONS of faculty candidate talks, but we still need to attend as many talks as possible.
- Dean candidates will begin visiting soon.
- IALS search spinning up soon. May mean candidates will be double booked.

*Track System:*

- Difficult to navigate enrollment priorities
- Basically running multiple degree programs
- Proposal 1: Tracks become concentrations
      - doesn't change graduation requirements
      - no enrollment priority
      - not reflected on transcript
- Proposal 2: Allow one course from outside college to count toward BS
- Proposal 3: Remove 377 and 383 as BS requirements
