# Search Updates
We are 100% through faculty recruiting this season! We have had 28 hiring talks: two dean talks, two research faculty talks, five security candidate talks, nine data science candidate talks, four lecturer interviews, and six IALS talks.

Although we have finishe the initial interview phase, this does not mean that related work is done -- we now have second visits and negotiation happening. 

**Dean Search** Still in negotiation; no updates.

**Security** We have two offers out; both candidates are coming for second visits in the next few days. Everyone: dress to impress!

**Data Science** Four offers are out; no movement on this front. Faculty are already engaged in email campaigns where it makes sense. There are some two-body issues involved, but overall there's a lot of enthusiasm about UMass from those with outstanding offers.

**Lecturer Recruiting** We currently have two outstanding offers, but no movement. Both candidates are very enthusiastic about UMass.

**IALS** The IALS search is an interdisciplinary endeavor between life sciences and various other departments. The search committee is hiring for two positions:

1. Building novel sensors and medical devices for health.
2. Use of medical devices in clinical medical applications.

There are two candidates in the former; four in the latter. The committee voted on recommendations to make to the search committee. Several of the above-threshold candidates have offers in hand. This position is atypical because there are no computer science faculty search chairs.

# Policies
The faculty voted to update the process for requesting and approving both student and faculty visitors.
