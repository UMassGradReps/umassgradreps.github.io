# Search Committees
We have concluded some searches, will postpone others, and still others are ongoing...

<!--break-->

**Data Science**

* [Justin Domke](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jdomke/) accepted our offer, will be joining CICS in the Fall
* One outstanding offer
* Discussion of making two more offers
  - Motion to make first new offer: passes 29-0
  - Motion to make second offer, pending the outstanding offer:
    + Concern about giving power to committee instead of just saying give him offer or not
	+ Motion amended: if rejected by both the outstanding offer and the first motion's offer, give one more offer
	Motion passes unanimously
* Considering one more data science research faculty offer

**IALS search**

* Search is still ongoing
* One candidate withdrew
* The IALS committee Seriously discussed the out-of-scope candidate, but ultimate decided they wanted to focus on medical devices and clinical applications (candidate was more HCI)
* Approved to make two offers

**Dean Search**

* Our outstanding offer was declined 
* [Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Bruce_Croft) will continue to be Dean for 1 yr
* Provost discussed future search

**Lecturer search**

Anticipate hiring the two lecturers with outstanding offers


# Incoming MS and PhD students

*Masters* 

* Terminal masters program: at least 2.5x masters admits as before
* Why? Good strategic and financial reasons, both for CICS and our relationship with the University.
* Revenue this year: > $1mil
* Financing support for new MS Students:
  - Start planning right now
  - Hire additional part time lecture staff and students to do lessons
  - Increase TA support all around
    Question from [Andrew McG](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/): **Can we hire enough TAs**?
	Answer: Probably? More MS/PhD students coming in, more Bay State
    + Encourage putting some RAs on half-TAs
    + Looking for RAs who see teaching as potential career
	* Focus some new teaching effort on 500/600 courses

*PhD*

* PhD admissions is mostly over (deadline passed on Apr 15)
* 34 PhD admits

# Space Issues
* No space for new faculty, where will we put them?
* In this building with “relatively uncontroversial moves”
* Some research group(s) (may need to)/(may have to) move. Question: which?


# Grad Cirriculum Update
* [Eliot](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~moss/): Email discussion among AI faculty, Recommending following change
  - AI core req be changed to allow 683 OR 689, not just 683


# Adjunct Appointments
* Updating bylaws on adjunct appointments
* Current std: Adjunct faculty can serve on PhD committees
* Adjunct can attend faculty meetings
* Current college process:
  + Appointments are 3 years at a time
  + First time by a vote of the faculty
  + Renewals and pre-hires are approved by P&T only
  + P&T alone is sufficient to aprove former faculty as adjuncts
* Currently have 23 adjunct faculties consisting of departed faculty, outsiders, umass faculty, people who we want a stronger relationship
* Goal: Update the adjunct expectations
* Adjuncts are appointed with the expectation that they will work directly with CICS faculty or students on research, teaching, or service projects. Stronger nominations will point toward such plans, and stronger renewing nominations will enumerate past efforts as well.
* Goal it to increase participation in dept
* Motion passes 24-1
