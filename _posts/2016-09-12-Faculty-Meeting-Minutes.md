# Faculty Meeting 9/12

- Robert Kozma is directing the BINDS lab in Hava's absence

- Dean's Comments
    - State of the college:
        - University has new budget review process: strategic planning process. Provost gets the strategic plan, which goes to the Chancellor, who approves it or not depending on the budget situation.
        - The big thing for us starting this year is that our financial situation is much improved so we can start discussing strategic investments at the local level.
        - Part of this is the influx of new MS students, bringing new energy and new money.
        - Money is being used to increase number of RAs by 15%, new staff, new teaching faculty at both MS and UGrad level. Eventually getting resources for tenure track. Potentially 1 new tenure track position this year due to the MS money.
        - Hiring new career advisor from central advising
        - Looking for a new advisor at junior/senior/masters levels
        - Doing tenure track hiring this year
        - Data science is hiring some number >= 2
        - Approved for new ISLES hire, will be a discussion at a future faculty meeting.
        - Next year: asking for more hiring in data science, hiring in IR/info science, will be discussed at retreat.
        - Brian is heavily focused on developing an online MS in cyber security
            - Focused in one area as a test
        - Putting in proposal for informatics degree this year
        - We're also going to be developing a proposal for a MS for informational and social computing
        - Discussing joint degrees at the UGrad level with linguistics (comp linguistics), English (digital humanities), political science (computational social science)
        - Space changes:
            - As a result of discussing with space planning administration people we are discussing taking the 2nd floor of LGRC back in the short term
            - Ongoing commitment for that space to keep improving it, turning it into a high quality space
        - Indirectly, has heard the Dean search is moving ahead. Talking about interviewing this fall.

- Proposal for MS Concentration in Security (Brian Levine)
    - MS degree: 10 classes total, 4 are cores, and 6 additional classes.
    - Security concentration is a strict subset of the existing MS, take 4 core classes (one must be 660), and you can take a second security class as a core
    - 2 of the 4 free electives must be taken from one of the security classes or take math or ece's crypto classes
    - Take 4 security classes total, 2 cores, 2 electives
    - Bundled with this is making 660 a MS (not PhD) systems core
    - James is worried about the core requirement not allowing people to back out of the track
    - Would also require that 660 is taught every year
    - Curriculum committee would look over proposal if it passes
    - Passes 37/0/1
- Space Task Force (Prashant Shenoy)
    - Discussions from last retreat:
        - There has been substantial new demands on space
        - LGRC space was underutilized, task force wanted to fix that
        - Suggestion was moving a research cluster to LGRC, but was met with negative feedback
    - Phase 1 of the plan was implemented over the summer
        - LGRC now has 6 faculty members
            - 5 teaching faculty
            - Several emeritus faculty
            - 5 new grad student labs to house around 35 students
            - All first year phd students and bay state students are in LGRC
            - Have research space for 4 groups
                - Rod and Joydeep's groups are already there
            - Have MS space (M-Space) also housed there
        - Created 5 new grad student labs with new furniture, new carpet, new cubicles.
            - Currently better equipped than the student cubes in CS
            - College put up some significant resources to make this happen
            - Rationale for why we decided to do this was it was a good way to make use of the space, putting the students together for at least 1 year it breaks down lab boundaries
                - Hopefully resulting in some collaborations
        - M-Space, MS mailboxes are in LGRC
            - Haven't done much of an update yet, still working on it
        - M-Space has a kitchen
        - We also own space in the GRC tower, with some labs and the ed-lab there
        - CS building update
            - Put all tenure track faculty in the CS building
            - Have freed up some space for Phase 2...
    - Cafe Opened
    - Phase 2
        - Trying to create more faculty offices: plan is to convert the remaining staff offices in the building into faculty offices.
            - Thinking about how to compress the space in the building now that there is less demand for grad student space
            - Trying to free up 1 to 2 student labs to convert into professional space, CIIR is offering one of their labs
            - This plan is why there are currently unused cubes
        - Phase 2 will happen over the course of the year
        - Planning to create one more new conference room on the 3rd floor in the printer room
        - Plans to convert utility closets to telephone booths
    - Report any feedback from graduate students
