CICS maintains a variety of both open and closed [mailing lists](https://mailman.cs.umass.edu/mailman/listinfo). Most mailing lists are private, meaning you cannot see who is a member. Open lists typically require a verification step to prevent others from subscribing you.

The mailing lists page and all sub-pages require you to sign in using your CICS username and password. If you have any trouble using the lists, contact `mailman@cs.umass.edu`.
