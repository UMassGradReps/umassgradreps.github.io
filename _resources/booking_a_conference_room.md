*UPDATED 27/11/16* CICS is now [using a form](https://www.cics.umass.edu/reservation) to book conference rooms. However, the front office has requested that you book rooms at least 48 hours in advance. If you need a room on short notice, it is still best to request a room using the instructions below:

The current way to book a conference room is to email `staff-mainoffice@cs.umass.edu`. Send them your date and time and the room capacity you want. Your lab/office key will work on all conference room doors in the CS building, except for 303.


Note that if there is no availability in the CS building, you may be given a room in LGRC. Your lab/office key will not work on these doors, so make sure you arrive early, in case you need to ask someone to unlock the door for you.

Note that there are [instructions](http://collab.cs.umass.edu/wiki/pages/H5B3052968/Connecting_to_the_Exchange_server_on_an_OS_X_machine.html) [for booking a conference room](http://collab.cs.umass.edu/wiki/pages/d1J296U/Exchange_Sharing_Calendars_and_connecting_to_Shared_Calendars.html) on the [Collab Wiki](http://collab.cs.umass.edu/wiki/projects). As of May 2016, these instructions are out of date. It is also possible that the college will be moving to a Google Apps-based calendar system, but this will probably not be happening in the near future.
