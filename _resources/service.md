title: Grad Student Service

We ask that each PhD and MS/PhD student complete at least one semester of
service during their time in the department. There are a variety of jobs
available every semester ranging from serious commitments like serving as a
GradRep to light and fun jobs like helping prepare Thursday Tea. Within our
rapidly growing department, maintaining the uniquely active and engaged
culture that has characterized CS at UMass is going to require even more
active participation from all of us, so please consider this a call-to-arms
for increased service in 2017 and beyond!

Here are some of the jobs that have traditionally been available at elections,
along with descriptions of each job at the bottom of the page.

## Grad Rep

Grad Reps have two primary duties. The first is attending faculty meetings, where they vote on behalf of the students to protect our interests. The second is to meet with faculty candidates during hiring season in the Spring. They also generally serve as our interface to the faculty and historically organize a few department-wide events, such as elections.

Grad Reps serve yearly terms, and 2 of the 4 reps are elected every semester. Unlike the other service positions, grad reps must be past candidacy (have passed Portfolio) in order to be eligible.

If you have any interest in continuing into academia after graduation, serving as a Grad Rep is a great way to look behind the scenes at the faculty hiring process and get a glimpse at the politics of the faculty. It's also a great way to make connections with the faculty while you're here.

## MS Rep

The MS Rep is the analogue to the Grad Reps from the MS students. They attend faculty meetings, meet with faculty candidates and organize with the Grad Reps. Basically, they act as a 5th Grad Rep who represents the Masters students.

The MS Rep is re-elected each semester, though there is no formal term limit, so an incumbent rep is possible. Ideally, we suggest that MS students in their first or last semesters not be MS Rep, but this is not required.

Being an MS Rep is a great way to connect with the faculty and PhD-track students. Faculty hiring is also a lesser burden on the MS Rep than the Grad Reps.

## GEO Stewards

GEO Stewards are our interface with the GEO body. One of the big things our stewards are involved with is the negotiating process when GEO renegotiates our contract with the university. The Stewards from each department meet regularly to discuss what they want to prioritize during the negotiations, then the GEO negotiating committee sits down with the university. This process is why we have a nice healthcare plan and other great benefits!

GEO also organizes students in response to things like late pay and other university breaches of contract. Our Stewards collect complaints from students in the department and report them back to the GEO leadership. In acute cases, the Stewards may serve as a 3rd-party semi-anonymous "union representative" when resolving disagreements between faculty and grad students, though GEO tends to recruit stewards from other departments to mediate these conflicts, so you would not be involved with conflicts in our department this way.

Finally, GEO Stewards organize a number of activism efforts on campus and with other universities. If you're interested, you can get involved with these meetings. The GEO Stewards are generally a friendly, cross-departmental group and good people to know. They've also started meetings specifically for GEO in STEM fields here at UMass that are also a great way to network. Food is usually served at the Steward meetings!

## GSS Senators

The Grad Student Senate votes on a lot of issues that directly impact the non-financial aspects of grad student life and the resources we have available to us. They organize a lot of fun networking events for all departments.

The number of senators each department gets depends on their number of students, so we have more senator positions than any other department on campus. However, historically we do not fill our available slots, and have thus been slightly disconnected from the GSS.

Senators are expected to attend at least 2 meetings per semester. Food is typically served at the meetings, which are about an hour and a half around lunch time.

## Treasurer

The treasurer manages the grad student bank account, which is generally used to fuel department-wide events that are not funded by the department. Typically this means reimbursing a few people per semester and collecting from our meager sources of income.

Traditionally, the treasurer holds their position for many years, to minimize the frequency we turn over financial control of our account.

The treasurer may also help with planning our fundraising efforts.

## Librarian

The librarian is responsible for the organization and upkeep the books in the common room. On the rare occasion someone wishes to loan a book from the common room, it is the librarian's duty to make sure it is eventually returned.

The librarian may also seek out ways to acquire new, more current materials for the library, typically through donations. For instance, starting to update some of the textbooks might make that common room library a very useful study resource.

## Slack Admin

The Slack admin manages our new Slack domain. This is a new position, so it's mostly up to you what this will look like!

## Tea Totallers

The Tea Totallers run Thursday Tea each week during the semester. This entails a few jobs, which are typically divided up between the totallers:
* Shopping for food (requires a car)
* Preparing food
* Cleaning up
* Requesting faculty sponsors
Typically you could probably expect this to take about one hour a week, depending on which duties you take. It's usually a lot of fun, and a good, easy break from work.

## New Student Committee

The NSC coordinate the Candidate Friday events. This is a lot of work for about a week in the Spring. They are responsible for the following pieces of Candidate Friday:
* Finding volunteers to host visiting students (Leeanne does the coordination between the students)
* Coordinating the Thursday night event (historically bowling)
  * This will include reserving a van (or two) from the university and driving students to/from the events that night
* Running the student panels on Friday
* Planning the Friday night party

At least one housemate from the house for Friday night should be on NSC.

## Social Committee

The Social Committee is an informal student organization that plans social events and outings for the department. It is a variable commitment position: you can just be involved with the discussions and brainstorming, or you can get help to plan a particular event you're interested in.

## Style File Maintainer

The style file maintainer is responsible for keeping a couple of LaTeX and Powerpoint templates up to date. The department has a thesis style file that (very) occasionally has a few changes that need to be made.

The position is historically very low-commitment, but you could get involved in collecting or even building new templates and style-files for the students here for posters, presentations or other documents.

## Intramural coordinator

UMass Amherst runs several intramural tournaments for almost every sport imaginable. These tournaments are generally not very competitive and a lot of fun. However, it is usually difficult for interested students in the department to find out about the events, or to organize themselves into a team.

The intramural coordinator sends out an announcement at the start of the Fall and Spring semesters with the intramurals going on that semester and connecting all the students interested in a sport so they can potentially form a team. Registration usually closes within a week or two from the start of the semester, so this email should go out in the first week of the semester!
