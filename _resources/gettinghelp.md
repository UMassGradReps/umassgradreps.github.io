During your graduate career, you may encounter certain sensitive issues that are more easily resolved with administrative support.  Here, we list several people whose responsibilities include supporting you throughout your time at UMass, especially when these issues arise.  We include instructional walkthroughs for a few common issues that may arise as well as descriptions for the people you are encouraged to seek support from.

Some common types of issues and how to resolve them.

### Student/Advisor Mediation

If you are experiencing issues with your advisor (e.g., disagreements), and you are uncomfortable broaching the subject with him or her, there are a number of people you can meet with to begin to resolve your issue.  You are encouraged to contact and seek advice from the Graduate Representatives who may have resolved similar circumstances during their graduate careers.  For more unique matters, please email the Graduate Program Director to set up a meeting.  One of the GPD's responsiblities is to meet and listen to students, especially when issues like these arise.  If your advisor happens to be the current GPD, you should instead contact the Program Chair to set up a meeting.  In some cases, it may make sense to involve the GEO Stewards, however, you should probably exhaust the above options before contacting them.

### Visa Issues

### Harassment/Bullying

## Grad Reps

The Grad Reps can serve as an "unofficial" anonymous mediator between you and the faculty or between you and other students. If you're unsure who else to take your issue to, the Grad Reps are a good place to start. Reporting things (even your seemingly minor issues) to the Grad Reps is a good way to give us anecdotes and ammunition to officially take your issues up with the faculty as aggregators. We have the power to propose changes, but only when we know about them!

As senior students, the Grad Reps are also great people to talk to if you ever have "general" concerns about life as a grad student, research progress/expectations or any other "grad life" issues that you don't want to bring up with your advisor.

## Advisor

Your advisor is not only a good person to talk to about research, but they are also a good person to talk to for advice on surviving grad school. After all, they did so once!

For a lot of people, coming to your advisor with your concerns can be very daunting, but in general, going to your advisor is a good way to get good advice, and to let your advisor what you're going through. Most advisors will be very receptive to this!

In particular, your advisor may also be a good person to go to if you have problems with another student in your lab or with a collaborator on one of your advisor's projects.

## Graduate Program Director

The GPD is essentially your ``meta''-advisor. If you are concerned with your advancement through the program or are having issues with your advisor, for example, the GPD is there to listen and help you overcome these obstacles.

## Masters Program Director

If you are concerned with your advancement through the program, for example, the MPD is there to listen and help you overcome these obstacles.

## Undergrad Program Director

If you are TAing or TOing an undergraduate class and have issues with an undergraduate, you could theoretically discuss them with the UPD.

## Chair

In general, the Chair is who you go to if you need to escalate an issue. If your issue was not resolved with the GPD or other administration, or if your issue is *with* one of those people, you can always go to the Chair.

## ~~Leeanne~~ Graduate Program Manager

Leeanne is the person to go to if you have questions or concerns about paperwork, requirements, deadlines, or any other administrative issues that may arise. Typically, people go to Leeanne for a lot of other issues, but really these are not officially her responsibility.

## IPO

For visa/immigration issues or questions, the UMass IPO is your best resource. The faculty and staff here often have out of date knowledge of these issues, but the IPO doesn't (of course). Don't rely on your advisor for visa advice, take it to the IPO.

## GEO Stewards

If you have issues with being overworked or stipends, the GEO Stewards can provide Union mediation.  They might send someone from another department to serve as a Union representative who might record the meeting between you and the concerned party.

## Dean

There's not much to take to the Dean, though you could escalate issues past the chair if you felt you needed another layer of appeal.

Note for editing: do you take issues regarding classes to the Dean?

## Title 9 Office

If you have experienced gender discrimination (including discrimination based on gender identity and expression), sexual harassment, sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and/or other sexual misconduct, please contact Title IX. They are committed to fair and prompt investigations, respect for the privacy of the parties, and due process and will handle your case appropriately and responsibly.
