# Faculty Hiring Talks
One of the major responsibilities of Grad Reps is to solicit feedback from the student body about faculty candidates. There are several ways you can engage with the faculty hiring process:

* Attend the faculty job talk. Tenure-track research candidates give research talks. Lecturer candidates teach a class. All job talks are recorded online and can be viewed using your CICS credentials at [here](http://podserv.cs.umass.edu/groups/facultytalks/).

* Attend the Grad Reps meeting. Grad Reps typically run a *non-technical* meeting with faculty candidates. You can learn about these meetings by:

    * Subscribing to the [CICS GradReps Calendar](). All open meetings should be listed here.

    * By email: `gradrep@cs.umass.edu` typically sends out emails announcing student meetings within 24 hours of the meeting, using the [template email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UMassGradReps/gradrep-resources/master/faculty_candidate_announcement_email_template.txt).

* Attend a lunch or dinner with the faculty candidate, typically organized by the faculty host. You can see who the faculty host is on the the CICS calendar description. Note that these events are frequently closed, but it doesn't hurt to express your interst to the faculty host. Note, however, they may not take kindly to multiple or pushy emails -- if you are not sure how to phrase your request, ask the Grad Reps first.
