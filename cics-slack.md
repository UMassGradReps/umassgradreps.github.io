## CICS Grads Slack Team

The graduate students in CICS have their own slack team that we use to advertise events, discuss interests, and generally chat with other students. It has semi-replaced the social mailing list as a way to quickly notifiy students about nearby events and messages. We have channels for things related to CS as well as hobbies such as board games, climbing, running, cooking, and much more. To join the slack team please follow the instructions below. If you have any questions please reach out to the current (~Spring 2017) Slack Admins: Lucas Chaufournier, Prateek Sharma, and Dan Saunders.
