#GradRep
Primary Duties:

As the name implies, the general task of grad reps is to represent the department's graduate student body to the faculty. The major task is to attend faculty meetings to keep abreast of issues that affect students and provide student perspective. Some guidelines are provided below; see also the GradRepManual.


Other Duties:


Organize Fall and spring picnics
Run grad elections
Social parties during the year
Interview faculty candidates
Run the Faculty Research Seminar in the fall


Picnics:

The fall picnic must be planned in early August so that a faculty member's house is available on the Friday evening during the first week of classes for a potluck dinner. New students should be told they do not have to bring a dish. Voting should take place for various 'best-of' food categories with a gift- such as wine- be given to the winner(s). [In fall 1997 we held an outdoor picnic instead and the feedback indicated the evening potluck dinner was preferred.]

The spring picnic is held on a Saturday in early May before exams. A faculty member may be kind enough to offer their house, but the picnic can also be set up at a park with protection in case of bad weather (I suggest Groff Park in Amherst). Call the Amherst LSSE office for permits. Call early in the semester.


Grad Elections:

There are a lot of offices to fill so arm twisting is almost always necessary. The positions toughest to fill are Coffee Czar(ina) and Grad Rep so try fill them first in the election. Debate rages back and forth on whether to offer the beer/food during the election or after; current theory states beer should be during the election. The exiting Coffee Czar(s) should receive a bottle of wine in appreciation (or a six-pack). It is also the responsibility of the grad reps to ensure the new Coffee crew has help from the old crew in the first MMC as a training session. And a final tidbit, we have discovered the hard way that first year students should not be Coffee Czar because they are overwhelmed with classes and settling into grad school.


Social Parties:

The grad reps are responsible for two social parties (also called anti-fragmentation parties) during each semester. These are usually held just before or after mid-terms.


Money:

The grad reps are responsible for getting all available funds from the department to support the social activities. The fall/spring picnics get about 250 each and the socials get about 75 each. These values are approximate and your mileage may vary.


Faculty Research Seminars:

Each fall faculty members present their current research to the new students as an informational/promotional seminar. The grad reps solicit available dates from the faculty, and they present their work for an hour in the large conference room. The department covers the cost of food and soda. Previous years have ordered chinese food or pizza for food. Grad reps are responsible for setup and cleanup. New students should attend.
